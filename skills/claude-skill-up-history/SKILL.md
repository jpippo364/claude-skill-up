# claude-skill-up-history

**IMPORTANT**: Every invocation MUST re-run the bash command fresh. Never use cached output.

Show command usage stats and completed quests. Run:

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/hooks/claude-skill-up/lib/engine.sh" && init_state && render_history
```

Display the output showing commands sorted by usage frequency and all completed quests marked with [x].
