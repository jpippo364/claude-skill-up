# claude-skill-up-share

**IMPORTANT**: Every invocation MUST re-run the bash command fresh. Never use cached output.

Generate an ASCII stat card the user can copy and share. Run:

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/hooks/claude-skill-up/lib/engine.sh" && init_state && render_share_card
```

Display the card in a code block so the user can easily copy it.
